Lego Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge is a fun and colorful adventure game that was released in 2001 for various platforms, including Windows PC. However, if you want to play the game on your computer today, you might encounter some problems. One of them is that you need to insert the original CD every time you want to launch the game, which can be annoying and inconvenient. Fortunately, there is a way to play Lego Island 2 without a CD, using a NoCD Patch.
 
A NoCD Patch is a file that modifies the game's executable so that it does not check for the presence of the CD when it runs. This way, you can play the game without having to insert the disc every time. There are different sources of NoCD Patches for Lego Island 2, but one of them is from GitHub user iSCNN, who created a patch that works for both Windows XP and Windows 10. You can find their patch here: [https://github.com/iscnn/lego-island-2-nocd-patch](https://github.com/iscnn/lego-island-2-nocd-patch).

To use the patch, you need to have Lego Island 2 installed on your computer. You can install it by exploring the CD and running INSTALL.exe. Then, you need to download the patch file from GitHub and extract it to your Lego Island 2 folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\LEGO Media\Games\LEGO Island 2. You should replace the existing LEGOIsland2.exe file with the patched one. After that, you can run the game without needing the CD.

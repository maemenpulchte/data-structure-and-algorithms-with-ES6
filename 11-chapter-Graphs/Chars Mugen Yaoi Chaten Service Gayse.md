Red Alert 2 was a highly anticipated and successful game in the German market. It was a real-time strategy game that was released in October 2000 by Electronic Arts. PC Player's Martin Schnelle predicted that it could be the best-selling game of the 2000 holiday season, as it had a loyal fan base and a strong marketing campaign.[23] His prediction was accurate, as Red Alert 2 topped the computer game sales rankings for October and November 2000, according to Media Control [de], a company that tracks sales data.[24][25] The game also received a "Gold" award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland [de] (VUD), an association of entertainment software publishers, at the end of November. This award meant that the game had sold at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.[26][27] Red Alert 2 continued to sell well in the following months, staying in Media Control's top 10 until February 2001,[24] and in the top 14 until March.[28] By May, the game had sold roughly 180,000 units in the German region, which was a very satisfying result for Electronic Arts, according to Udo Hoffman of PC Player.[24]

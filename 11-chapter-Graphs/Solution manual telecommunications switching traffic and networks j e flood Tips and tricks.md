Telecommunication Switching, Traffic and Networks is a book by J.E. Flood that covers the topics of switching, signalling and traffic in the context of telecommunications networks. It introduces networks through the evolution of switching systems from electromechanical systems to stored-program-controlled digital systems and future broadband systems. It also covers modern digital networks, digital transmission, synchronous digital hierarchy, broadband networks including ATM, and integrated services digital network (ISDN). The book is intended for use on graduate courses in telecommunications.
 
The book is divided into 13 chapters, each covering a different aspect of telecommunications switching, traffic and networks. The first chapter provides an introduction to the basic concepts and terminology of telecommunications networks. The second chapter reviews the history and development of switching systems from manual to automatic systems. The third chapter describes the principles and operation of electromechanical switching systems such as Strowger, crossbar and reed-relay systems. The fourth chapter explains the functions and features of stored-program-controlled digital switching systems such as common control, distributed control and software architecture. The fifth chapter discusses the modern digital switching systems such as time-division multiplexing (TDM), space-division multiplexing (SDM), time-space-time (TST) switching and non-blocking switching. The sixth chapter introduces the digital transmission systems such as pulse code modulation (PCM), line coding, multiplexing, synchronization and error control. The seventh chapter presents the synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) as a standard for high-speed digital transmission over optical fibers. The eighth chapter explores the broadband networks such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), which is a packet-switching technique for transmitting voice, data and video over high-speed networks. The ninth chapter describes the integrated services digital network (ISDN), which is a network that provides end-to-end digital connectivity for various services such as voice, data and video. The tenth chapter explains the signalling systems such as common channel signalling (CCS), which is a method of transmitting signalling information over a separate channel from the voice or data channels. The eleventh chapter covers the traffic engineering concepts such as traffic intensity, grade of service, blocking probability and Erlang formulas. The twelfth chapter discusses the network management functions such as fault management, configuration management, performance management and security management. The thirteenth chapter provides an overview of the future trends and challenges in telecommunications networks such as next-generation networks (NGN), internet protocol (IP) telephony and wireless communications.

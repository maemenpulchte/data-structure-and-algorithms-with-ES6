One of the common issues that players encounter when playing Crysis 3 is the lack of voice acting in the cutscenes when using a non-English language setting. This can be very frustrating and immersion-breaking, especially for those who want to enjoy the story and characters of the game.
 
Fortunately, there is a simple solution to this problem that does not require any complicated modding or editing. All you need is a file called `Videos2.pak`, which contains the audio files for the cutscenes in different languages. You can download this file from various sources online, such as Steam Community[^1^], Mod DB[^2^], or Nexus Mods[^3^]. Here are the steps to fix the cutscene audio problem in Crysis 3:
 
1. Download the `Videos2.pak` file from one of the links above. Make sure you choose the right version for your language setting.
2. Locate your Crysis 3 game folder. This can vary depending on where you installed the game and which platform you are using (Steam or Origin). For example, if you are using Steam on Windows, it might be something like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Crysis 3`.
3. Inside your game folder, find and open the `C3` subfolder. This is where the game files are stored.
4. Paste the `Videos2.pak` file that you downloaded into this subfolder. You will be asked to overwrite the existing file with the same name. Choose yes to confirm.
5. Launch Crysis 3 and select your preferred language in the game settings. You can also change your language setting in Steam or Origin if you prefer.
6. Enjoy the game with voice acting in the cutscenes!

If you enjoyed playing Crysis 3 and want to get the most out of your gaming experience, here are some more tips and tricks that you might find useful:

- Use the Nanosuit to your advantage. The Nanosuit is your best friend in Crysis 3, as it allows you to switch between different modes that enhance your abilities. You can use Armor mode to increase your durability and reduce damage, Stealth mode to become invisible and silent, Power mode to boost your strength and speed, and Hack mode to interact with electronic devices and enemy weapons. Experiment with different combinations of modes and find the ones that suit your playstyle and situation.
- Explore the environment and find collectibles. Crysis 3 has a rich and detailed environment that is full of secrets and hidden items. You can find collectibles such as data pads, black boxes, propaganda posters, and nanosuit upgrade kits that can provide you with more information, backstory, and customization options. You can also find weapons and ammo caches that can help you replenish your arsenal. Use your visor to scan the area and highlight any points of interest.
- Use the bow and arrow for stealth kills. The bow and arrow is one of the most versatile and powerful weapons in Crysis 3. It can fire different types of arrows that have different effects, such as explosive, electric, or thermite arrows. The best thing about the bow is that it does not break your stealth when you fire it, unlike other weapons. This means you can take out enemies silently and efficiently without alerting others. You can also retrieve your arrows from corpses or walls if you need more ammo.

You can attach different attachments to your weapons, such as scopes, silencers, lasers, or extended magazines.

You can access the customization menu by pressing the back button on your controller or the tab key on your keyboard.
- Have fun with the multiplayer modes. Crysis 3 has a variety of multiplayer modes that you can play with or against other players online. You can choose from modes such as Team Deathmatch, Capture the Relay, Hunter, Crash Site, Extraction, or Spears. Each mode has its own objectives and rules that require teamwork and strategy. You can also unlock new weapons, attachments, modules, skins, and dog tags as you level up your rank and earn experience points.
